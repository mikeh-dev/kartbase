KartBase V1 - First Self-Guided Rails Development Project

Bootstrap styling (Basic)
no Auth
A single Entry model only uses basic CRUD and partials.

This is my first self-guided project, I did use some aspects from previous tutorial projects I worked on but everything else was built from knowledge and the usual assault on StackOverflow, Google etc.

The idea behind the App was to record data for Karting chassis and engine setup from practice and race sessions which I had been writing down manually up to this point. I deployed the app on Heroku and used it in the real world making changes between weekends based on notes I took whilst using. I never had the confidence to let anyone else use it due to the poor UI and styling.

I styled it with Bootstrap4 at the time.
